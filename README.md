# Dim for Omarchy

Dim every display with a black overlay. Toggle it from the bar and adjust its strength from the monitor panel. This bundle includes the `oma.dim` service, the `oma.monitor` monitor widget, and the `oma.indicators` status widget.

## Install

Run **both commands**. Omarchy's first command adds only `oma.dim`; the second installs the CLI and both companion widgets, then enables the complete set:

```sh
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/yogeshsuryag/oma.dim.git
"$HOME/.config/omarchy/plugins/oma.dim/install"
```

Wait for `Installed and enabled: oma.dim, oma.monitor, oma.indicators.` before using Dim. The installer backs up your shell configuration and replaces the stock Monitor and Indicators widgets in their existing positions, preserving unrelated widgets and settings.

Requires Omarchy Quattro with a running shell. The installer uses its existing `omarchy`, `omarchy-shell`, Bash, Git, `jq`, coreutils, and diffutils commands. No sudo is required. Installation changes only your user plugin directories, bar configuration, and `~/.local/bin/dim`.

## Use

Use `dim` to toggle dimming, check status, change strength, or enable and disable Dim:

```sh
dim toggle
dim status
dim strength 60
dim enable
dim disable
```

Run `dim` or `dim help` to see the command list. `dim status` shows whether Dim is enabled or dimming and reports its strength. `dim strength` shows the current strength; `dim strength 60` sets it from `0` to `100` while preserving the current on/off state, with `0` hiding the overlay. If `dim toggle` or `dim strength` reports `Dim is disabled. Run: dim enable`, run `dim enable` to enable all three plugins. `dim disable` turns the overlay off and disables the plugins while keeping their files and saved strength. The `dim` command is installed in `~/.local/bin`.

## Remove

Run `dim remove` to disable and remove Dim, its companion widgets, and the `dim` command. Your saved strength setting is retained.
